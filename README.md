# mf83_solitaire_solver
A solver for the solitaire minigame in Zachtronics' Mobius Front '83

Right now, this repo requires you to manually put your gamestate in main.x.cpp and recompile to get a solution. Future plans are to automatically read the screen, run the solver, and click the screen to get input the solution.
